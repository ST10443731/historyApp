History is a  significant part of every individual as we get to know about what and who let us to where we are.We get to learn about how we got where we are 
and why we live the way we do and the THE HISTORY APP is created for the perposes of educating the young minds about those who came before us and the impact 
they had while alive .The History app is created to make it more easier for the learners to obtain the inforamtion.
The history app is created to teach learners about history but in a more morden way where learner can be inpired to learn more about history using what they
are familiar with which is technology.It is created for the perposes of making learning more enjoyable for learners . Not only with the learner the app 
can also help the educators in preparing for their lesson with learners which will make it more easier by getting the information they will need easily 
and faster.The app will not only make it fun for the learners but it will make it even more enjoyable for the educators to educate .

Every historic figure in this app has made significant impact during their time .

Now here i will discuss about the display of the app.Firstly i used a morden but also historic library background to grap the attention of the users before even 
using it. The background is surely to make the users interested. The title on the top is to give the user an idea on what the app is about. I gave as much as possible
clear instructions that they as the user should do to start.I added two buttons one being for the result and one being  to clear the displayed results.Both buttons have a 
visible text for the user to know which button is for display and the other to clear.when the user insert a certain age that is in the age criteria selected the app 
will generate the information that is linked to the age inserted but if the user insert an age that is not in the selected age criteria the app wil display a massege
that will prompt the user to re-insert the age that is in the selected age criteria.The age will be linked to the historic figures'age but in this case the age they
passed on in. The app was tested to make sure that the user using it will enjoy.

Here i will discuss how i used github.It is used to run test and build my code to make sure that the app will work on not just my computer but other users too but also that 
it may function how it is expected to  function.
